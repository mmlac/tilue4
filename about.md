## Welcome to Today I learned: Unreal Engine 4!

In this blog I will be posting about my journey in learning Unreal Engine 4 and building my first project.

### Why do you write this blog?
Mostly as a reference to myself and with the hope that it might help other people that are trying to get
into UE4 :)

### What's this first project you are speaking of?
 TBD :P

### How do I give feedback?
There are a couple of ways:
- Comment below the post in question
- File an issue in GitHub ( ideally just use those in conjunction with a pull request - otherwise your comments are hard to find. Prefer the comments for general tips)
- Submit a pull request via GitHub (if I have errors and you just want to fix them real quick :) )
